##Methods Used:
Descriptive Statistics Data Visualization Machine Learning Technologies Python Pandas Numpy Matplotlib Seaborn Scikit-learn XGBoost
##Project Description:
##EDA:
Performed exploratory data analysis on numerical and categorical data.

##Data Cleaning:
Missing value imputation, Outlier Treatment

##Imbalance handling:
First tried Under sampling and implemented baseline models then due to loss of information moved to different technique i.e oversampling using SMOTE and got better 
results.

##Feature Selection:
Used information gain for feature selection and dropped features which had less information gain

##Model development:
Tried different model and finally compared all models F1 and roc_auc score.

##Needs of this project:
Data exploration/descriptive statistics

Data processing/cleaning

Predictive modeling
